# UFOs
Building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, creating filters to make the table fully dynamic, and placing the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.  The webpage is customized using Bootstrap.

## Challenge Summary
### Purpose
- This project outlines very versatile and useful aspects of JavaScript and HTML. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the capability of JavaScript to hold and manipulate massive amounts of data and then display it in a very user-friendly environment through HTML. This allows users who have no idea on how JavaScript or HTML works the capability to filter through the data and perform their own analysis or just expand their knowledge on the subject.
### Technical Aspects
- To make the cohesive table display and filtering possible through JavaScript, a few key features of JavaScript were used.  The primary feature is D3, which stands for Data-Driven Documents, and is by far the most important for this project. It is a JavaScript library specifically for manipulating documents based on data. This gives JavaScript the capability to easily select user inputs from HTML and pull them into JavaScript so functions and methods can be applied to them. D3 also gives JavaScript the ability to respond to clicks or entries in the webpage without having to hard code it in the HTML.  This allows for far more interactive website capabilities that would be impossible if only HTML was used. 
- Other features that were used within JavaScript to perform the project are key aspects of programing in general. These are the creation of functions, the ability to loop through data and the ability to filter data based on conditions. The primary differences between creating functions in JavaScript compared to other languages are purely syntactical. Looping through data can either be performed by for or the method forEach() which is specifically for looping through arrays. Filtering through data operates the most differently compared to these other concepts in JavaScript. The filter() method in JavaScript requires an anonymous arrow function within the method in order for it to operate. This is because the method needs to know how to loop through the data for it to apply the filter correctly.
### Development Recommendations
- In this challenge, 5 filter inputs were added to the HTML and the event listener in JavaScript was set to apply the input extraction, data filtering and recreation of the table each time an input is submitted. To allow a more streamlined way to clear the filters and return the table to original state, I recommend adding a clear filters button bellow the inputs. Below is the D3 event listener that connects to the HTML and the function required to clear the filter inputs, filter variable and return the table to its original form.
